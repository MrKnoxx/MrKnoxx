# 👋 Hi, I'm MrKnoxx

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a pragmatic developer focused on building scalable, secure, and user-friendly automation tools—especially in the realm of OSINT and Discord bot development.

## 🧠 What I Do

- ⚙️ **Discord Bot Architect**  
  Crafting advanced bots with button-based UIs, persistent premium user systems, and robust error handling using `discord.py`.

- 🔍 **OSINT Automation**  
  Building tools that streamline information gathering with precision and speed—because manual lookup is so last decade.

- 🔗 **API Integration Mastery**  
  Seamlessly connecting services with clean HTTP requests, smart JSON handling, and chunked message delivery to stay within platform limits.

- 💾 **Persistent Data Storage**  
  Using JSON-based configurations and user management systems that are secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Language | Frameworks & Tools | Specialties |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Python 🐍 | discord.py, requests, asyncio | Bot development, API integration |
| JSON 📦 | Custom config systems | Persistent user data |
| Git & GitHub 🛠️ | CI/CD ready | Version control & collaboration |

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **OSINT Lookup Bot**  
  A premium-gated Discord bot that automates data retrieval with a sleek button UI and secure access control.

- **Premium User Manager**  
  JSON-backed system for managing exclusive features and owner checks—because not all users are created equal.

- **Error-Handled Command Suite**  
  Commands that fail gracefully and log intelligently. No more silent crashes or cryptic tracebacks.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I’m always open to feedback, feature requests, and collaborative debugging. If you’ve got a cool idea or need help refining your bot, feel free to reach out.
